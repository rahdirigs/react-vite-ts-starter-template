# About the template

A personal starting point for React Projects with Typescript that is scaffolded using Vite instead of CRA.

## Additional packages on top of the barebones Vite scaffold

- `react-router-dom` to enable routing
- `eslint` and `prettier` for linting and code formatting purposes respectively
- `eslint-config-airbnb` as a style-guide of choice
- `react-simple-import-sort` plugin to automatically sort different types of imports within a component or utility script
- Some `eslint` rules relaxed or enforced to make life easier
- Cleanup `assets` folder and contents of `App.tsx`
- Deleted `App.css` and contents of `index.css`

## Usage

- Clone this repository.
- `cd react-vite-ts-starter-template`
- `npm install` or `yarn install` based on the preferred package manager
- `npm run dev` to get the development server up and running
